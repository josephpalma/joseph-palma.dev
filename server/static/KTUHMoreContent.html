      <p class="read-more_content-p">
        KTUH FM is a public, college radio station which broadcasts live on the air 24/7 in Hawai’i. On O’ahu, 
        where the only other public radio station is NPR, KTUH is a staple in the community.
        With 10% of its 20,000 daily listeners tuning in online - the stream has become a signature of the station, 
        allowing greater access to broadcasts within the community and around the world.        
      </p>
      <h4 class="read-more_content-title">Challenges</h4>
      <p class="read-more_content-p">
        We heard stories from DJ’s, listeners, administrators and staff, which helped us gain a better insight into the needs of users. Stories were then broken into three categories:

            Content management - with the constant churn of student employee’s, how do we utilize a content management system to provide as little onboarding overhead as possible?

            UX Concerns - an outdated stream player. How can we keep the stream playing while users navigate the site?

    <h4 class="read-more_content-title" style="margin-top: 12px">Web App Solution</h4>
    <p class="read-more_content-p">
      We successfully built a web app that solved the digital issues faced by staff, DJ’s and listeners. 
      Choosing React as a front-end library allowed us to componentize the existing website's design. 
      Its stateful Hooks such as useContext, enabled an awesome streaming experience. 
      Wordpress became the tried and true CMS after we found it was used for previous iterations of the website - 
      so many DJ’s had experience with it.  
    </p>
    <p class="read-more_content-p">
      Since Wordpress uses PHP as its scripting language, we choose to build a PHP API for all things http: content, streaming, and hosting. 
      Previously, the site was hosted and maintained by a sole developer, so we worked with the University to run our new app on their industrial scale server system - 
      complete with an in-house IT staff and backed by the resources of the University.
    </p>
    <h4 class="read-more_content-title" style="margin-top: 12px">Bigger Picture</h4>
    <p class="read-more_content-p">
      With a task like integrating two domains which have little historical overlap, success was found in the stories of users. 
      By talking to public radio listeners, we learned more about the intricacies of online listening. 
      By talking to administrators, we developed a hosting plan that better utilized the resources of the organization.
